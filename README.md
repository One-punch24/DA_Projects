## DA Projects

Repo for EPFL CS-451 Distributed Algorithms.

* proj1 branch: Perfect Link.
* proj2 branch: FIFO Broadcast. In my submission, I didn't deal with the conflict problem (I forgot to add those locks in my submission), but it still seemed to perform well in the online test.
* master branch: Lattice Agreement. Without the naive lock, the running results were wrong and sometimes the program got stuck.
